Project done as part of Python Specialization course on Coursera- https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-project?specialization=python-3-programming. 
Project uses Optical Character Recognition(Tessaract OCR lib), PIL and OpenCV libraries.

Decription:

Take a ZIP file of images and process them using python built in library. The files in the ZIP file are newspaper images. The python code allows one to search through the images looking for the occurrences of keywords and faces. E.g. if you search for "pizza" it will return a contact sheet of all of the faces which were located on the newspaper page which mentions "pizza". THe pgm uses OpenCV to detect faces, tesseract to do optical character recognition, and PIL to composite images together into contact sheets.
Each page of the newspapers is saved as a single PNG image in a file called images.zip. These newspapers are in english, and contain a variety of stories, advertisements and images.
